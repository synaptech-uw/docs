Getting Started with the Arduino:

Note: The Muscle Spiker Shield is only compatible with the Arduino Uno.

1. Place the Muscle Spiker Shield on the Arduino Uno in the correct configuration (this configuration is pretty intuitive).
2. Connect the Arduino to your computer and open the Arduino IDE.
3. File >> Save As >> {File Name}
4. Tools >> Board >> Select "Arduino/Genuino Uno"
5. Make sure power light is bright on the Arduino.
6. Write your code! For more info, see the "Coding" document.
7. Press the right hand arrow at the top of the software to upload your code to the Arduino.
You could also click the check mark to verify your code doesnt not have any errors before uploading.
8. That's it!
