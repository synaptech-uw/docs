Open powershell as administrator by right clicking and selecting run as administrator
In Powershell type the following hitting enter after entering each command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install nodejs
choco install miniconda
choco install miniconda3
choco install vcbuildtools

Go to:
https://github.com/NeurotechBerkeley/bci-course/tree/master
Click clone or download and download zip file
After unzipping the file move the lab 3 folder to a an easy to find location
Doing this will be useful later

Insert the dongle
Install Zadig and use it to get a proper driver for the dongle
https://zadig.akeo.ie/

Now open anaconda powershell prompt
Navigate to the lab three file in powershell using
cd "file address"
Note, copy the file address and paste in in the quotes
Run the following:
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install muselsl
Pip install vispy
Pip install PyQt5
Pip install pyautogui
Pip install pylsl

You now have everything you need to connect to and stream data from the ganglion
The prior steps need only be completed once

To turn on the ganglion plug in the battery pack and flip the power switch next to the battery port

To connect to the ganglion, in anaconda powershell prompt type:
node ganglion-lsl.js

To view the data streaming from the Ganglion, in a second anaconda powershell prompt type:
Muselsl view -v2

You should now see a graph of the data
Now time to connect the electrodes
The pins are divided into eight labeled groups of two
The top pin of each group will record from the muscle the connected electrode is connected to
The bottom pin represents the reference electrode for the top one, connect it to something that does not give an electrical signal like a bone
Only four pin sets should have electrodes connected; R3, R5, R7, and R6

You should now be seeing raw data from the electrodes
How to work with this data will be explained in a seperate document.
You should now
